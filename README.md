# Utility Programs Collection  

This repository contains three simple and intuitive utility programs written in Python:  

- **File Converter** – Import image and PDF files and convert them into various formats.  
- **PDF Merger** – Merge multiple PDF files into a single document.  
- **QR Generator** – Generate QR codes with ease.  

## Usage  

You can use these programs in one of several ways:  

1. **Run the Python files directly** – Simply execute the desired script using Python.
   - Run *pip install pypdf pillow_heif pillow qrcode* to install all required packages.
2. **Create a standalone Windows executable** – Use `pyinstaller` to package any program into a portable executable.  
   - To do this, navigate to the source folder of the program you want to compile and run the `pyinstaller` command specified in the comments of each Python file.
   - Before this can be done the required packages must also be installed.
3.**Download Windoes executables from itch.io** - THe executables can be downloaded directly [here](https://mxxhb.itch.io/utilities-you-use-websites-for).
