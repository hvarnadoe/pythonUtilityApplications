This is a coolection of three utility programs I created in python.
File converter allows the user to import image and PDF files and convert the extension into various other formats.
PDF Merger allows the user to merge PDFs together.
QR Generator allows the user to generate QR codes.

All the applications were created to be incredibly simple and intuitive.

To use these programs you can either run the python files directly or can be packaged into a portable windows executable using pyinstaller by navigating to the source folder of the program you woulld like to compile in terminal and running the command found in the comments of each python file.
