 Hello, my name is Harrison Varnido. We were on project UC 202 and we made a building map application I worked with Lucas Haas at Epion and Zach Wilson So for our app Zach was inspired by stories that his mom told him from the children's hospital at Atlanta With the new Arthur and Blank Hospital where families were having a hard time navigating the building and finding their kids So that was our inspiration for the app was to create a way to navigate buildings more easily so that Some of the stress of being in a new place goes away So our solution to this problem was to create an intuitive mobile application that would allow users to just select their Starting location where they want to go and then it will generate a route for them We also wanted to include Some nicer features such as a light and dark mode as well as QR codes which you can scan as your Kind of find me All right, I'm Lucas Haas one of the lead designers of the application So to go through the app flow we wanted to make a very user-friendly User-centric application that helps you search a indoor building almost like an indoor GPS So to go through the basics real quick we have a starting page that will allow you to use a QR code to scan in almost give you a Mall map like you are here Location to show where you are and then pinpoint a in location to find your route So if you go to the sidebar we have a hamburger menu that shows a destination map about us some simple tabs and pages you can traverse the will sheen the demo the Map page with the algorithm that'll push out the route for you and then the route created which this is our ideal route in the end with Locations so to transition over we'll go into the the demo now pushing into the demo so We'll open up into this screen which is our destination screen which will show us the instructions of how to run the app So you're gonna want to scan a QR code which I can up real quick Which will show us A room to say a QR code was on this TV you would scan the QR code and then it would punch you back into the app And push you into the map screen in which world will show you your current location and then you'll plug in your final destination And which it'll do the map for you Another simple page to go through we have our about us which is just everything we kind of discussed today We have the team members our mission story approach Just kind of a general page to show our growth of the project and where we were We have a settings tab to push things into dark mode a size for those That need a larger size to see or smaller to fit more text on the screen to go back to the about us to have it more in a paragraph form um And then yeah, I'm gonna hand this back over to Harrison to show us the the algorithm that we use So for this project we just implemented a pretty simple dikes was algorithm We were we built this application using the flutter framework which has a package for dikes specifically So what we do is we store the different rooms nodes in this case and in a JSON format and Then we parse that JSON to create a graph of all of the rooms and how they're connected through the hallways From there we can plug in your current location and the destination and From there it will generate a route We are currently still working on the Displaying of the route. So for this demo, it will just be nodes for the steps However come cd if you stop by our booth will have those routes fully working so you can stop by and see how that looks now Thank you everybody for your time We hope to see you stop by our booth at cd and I hope you have a great night. Thanks
